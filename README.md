# esp8266-light

ESP8266 (ESP-01) Controlled Light.

Idea is to collect all info together so that it will be possible to everyone to make the same project from scratch if it's wanted.

There will be the code, schemas and photos as well as descriptions what has been made.
See [wiki page](https://github.com/zhuj/esp8266-light/wiki) for more info.

### Current status picture

There will be the picture of the project status (will be updated each time I have something new to show):
